They want to figure out how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on some features and has approached you for help. They want you to try out some regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent a DVD for. The company wants a model which yeilds a MSE of 3 or less on a test set. The model you make will help the company become more efficient inventory planning.\n","\n","The data they provided is in the csv file `rental_info.csv`. It has the following features:\n","- `\"rental_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer rents the DVD.\n","- `\"return_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer returns the DVD.\n","- `\"amount\"`: The amount paid by the customer for renting the DVD.\n","- `\"amount_2\"`: The square of `\"amount\"`.\n","- `\"rental_rate\"`: The rate at which the DVD is rented for.\n","- `\"rental_rate_2\"`: The square of `\"rental_rate\"`.\n","- `\"release_year\"`: The year the movie being rented was released.\n","- `\"length\"`: Lenght of the movie being rented, in minuites.\n","- `\"length_2\"`: The square of `\"length\"`.\n","- `\"replacement_cost\"`: The amount it will cost the company to replace the DVD.\n","- `\"special_features\"`: Any special features, for example trailers/deleted scenes that the DVD also has.\n","- `\"NC-17\"`, `\"PG\"`, `\"PG-13\"`, `\"R\"`: These columns are dummy variables of the rating of the movie.
